Having issues? Here are quick fixes.

## Bot not responding

- Check if Neon is online.
- Make sure the bot has the required perms.
- Check the prefix (try mentioning Neon to see it).
- Make sure Neonâ€™s role is high enough in the role list.

## Commands not working

- Check if you have permission for the command.
- Try using the full command (e.g. `n!help`).
- Make sure the command is enabled.

## Still stuck?

- Ask for help in the [support server](https://discord.gg/7jHrgkAAzm).
