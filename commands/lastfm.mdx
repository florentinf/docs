Set up Last.fm with neon to show your music and stats.

## What is Last.fm?

Last.fm tracks the music you play. Neon can read that and show it in Discord.

### Step 1 ‚Äî Create a Last.fm account

1. Go to [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/join) and [sign up](https://www.last.fm/join).
2. Confirm your email.
3. Enable scrobbling.

<Note>
  You need to remember your Last.fm username so you can afterwards connect it to neon.
</Note>

### Step 2 ‚Äî Link your account to neon

Link once per user.

```
n!login [lastfm_username]
```

Example:

```
n!login f-ff
```

Check your link:

```
n!whois
```

Unlink (if needed):

```
n!logout
```

### Step 3 ‚Äî Test it

See your current track:

```
n!nowplaying
```

Check someone else:

```
n!nowplaying @username
```

## Last.fm Custom Embed

Use `n!fmembed` to fully customize your now playing embed.

- Pick global (all servers) or server-only (needs Neon Premium).
- Change style, text, and [variables](https://www.resource/variables.mxd) in the menu.
- Switch or reset any time.

Commands:

```
n!fmembed
n!fmembed enable
n!fmembed disable
n!fmembed reset
n!fmembed variables
```

## Period values

Use a time window for ‚Äútop‚Äù commands. Examples:

- 7days
- 1month
- 3months
- 6months
- 12months
- overall

Example:

```
n!topartists 7days
n!toptracks overall @nxsi
```

## Quick examples

```
n!login nxsii
n!nowplaying
n!topartists 7days
n!toptracks overall @nxsi
n!imgtar 7days nxsii
n!fmreactions üîº üîΩ
```

## Tips

- Mention a user, or pass a Last.fm username, to check others.
- Cooldowns apply (you may need to wait a second or two).

## Troubleshooting

- ‚ÄúUser not found‚Äù: check your Last.fm username spelling.
- No data: make sure you have scrobbles on Last.fm.
- Nothing updates: your player may not be scrobbling.
- Reactions not changing: you may need NeonPremium for more than 2 custom reactions.
- Server reactions: you need Manage Server to run the server subcommands.
