Antinuke protects your server from destructive actions by staff, like mass bans or channel deletions.

## What it does

- Monitors actions like emoji, channel, and role creation/deletion, as well as member kicks and bans.
- Lets you set a threshold for each type of action—if too many happen too quickly, Antinuke steps in.
- You can choose how to punish: kick, ban, or remove roles from the offending user.
- Whitelist trusted staff so Antinuke ignores their actions (only whitelist people you fully trust!).

## Usage

```
n!antinuke enable [module]
n!antinuke disable [module]
n!antinuke logchannel [channel/none]
n!antinuke action [module] [kick/ban/removeroles/none]
n!antinuke threshold [module] [2-10]
n!antinuke whitelist [user]
```

## Recommended Settings

- Enable protection for all modules (emojiDelete, channelCreate, channelDelete, roleCreate, roleDelete, memberKick, memberBan).
- Set actions for dangerous permissions (like ban or removeroles) to "ban" or "stripstaff".
- Use low thresholds for channel/role/emoji deletes (1–2).
- Only whitelist users who are completely trusted.
- Make one owner an Antinuke admin so only they can change these settings.

**Example:**

```
n!antinuke enable channelDelete
n!antinuke action channelDelete ban
n!antinuke threshold channelDelete 1
n!antinuke whitelist @trustedmod
```
