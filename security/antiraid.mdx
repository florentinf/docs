title: "Antiraid "
---

Antiraid protects your server from mass join raids.

## What it does

- Detects when multiple users join in a short time.
- Auto-kicks or bans suspicious accounts.
- Lets you set a threshold for how many joins trigger the protection.
- Logs all raid events to a channel.

## Usage

```
n!antiraid enable
n!antiraid logchannel [channel]
n!antiraid action [kick/ban]
n!antiraid threshold [2-10]
n!antiraid config
```

## Recommended Settings

- Set the action to "ban" for higher security, or "kick" for less strict.
- Use a threshold of 3â€“5 joins in 2 seconds for medium-sized servers.
- Always set a log channel to keep track of raid events.

**Example:**

```
n!antiraid enable
n!antiraid action ban
n!antiraid threshold 4
n!antiraid logchannel #antiraidlog
```
