Fake Permissions let you give roles or users permission to use bot commands, even if they don't have the real Discord permissions.

## What it does

- Grants "fake" permissions for bot commands.
- Lets you control which roles/users can use specific commands.
- Useful for giving trusted mods more access without making them full admins.

## Usage

```
n!fp grant [role/user] [permission]
n!fp remove [role/user] [permission]
n!fp list (role or user)
n!fp permissions
```

## Recommended Settings

- Grant administrator fake perms only to co-owners or trusted staff.
- Give admin roles permissions like manage_messages, moderate_members, manage_nicknames, manage_roles, ban_members, kick_members.
- Give mod roles basic moderation permissions (manage_messages, moderate_members, kick_members).
- Only grant permissions to roles/users you trust.

**Example:**

```
n!fp grant @coowner administrator
n!fp grant @admin manage_messages
n!fp grant @mod kick_members
n!fp list
```
